JUST READ THIS IF YOU WANT EDIT NUI.

If you want to change the NUI itself, you will need to install NodeJs on your computer. 
After that, open the VueJs folder at the cmd prompt, type npm install. 
Wait for the installation.

Make the changes you want and when you're done, type npm run build. 
A folder called “dist” will be created inside the VueJs folder, copy what's inside, 
go to the resource/lg_manage_store/html folder and delete everything inside and paste the generated files.

If you have the server on, you will need to use the refresh command and then restart lg_manage_store once.
