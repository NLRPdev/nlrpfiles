### BOII | Development - Pawnshop Script V2 ###

Here we have our updated pawnshop script.
Script comes with three established locations, with peds.
Each store is setup with qbcore base items however they are highly expandable.
Each store location has a toggled time system.
Gold bar smelting location is included.
Enjoy :) 

### USAGE ###

- Use third eye to access the peds
- Use third eye to target smelting location
- Everything else through menu

### INSTALL ###

1) Customise to your liking, support can be provided if needed
2) Drag and drop `boii-pawnshop` into your server resources
